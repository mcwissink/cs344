a. Task 1: Is a linear model ever preferable to a deep NN model?
When you expect the a relationship to be linear, a linear model will probably give a better fit.

b. Task 2: Does the NN model do better than the linear model?
Yes, in all areas - accuracy, precision, and recall - the NN outperforms the linear model.

c. Task 3: Do embeddings do much good for sentiment analysis tasks?
Embeddings is a convenient method for finding relationships and correlations between different words, this makes sentiment analysis easier when compared to other points in the dataset.

d. Tasks 4â€“5: Name two words that have similar embeddings and explain why that makes sense.
comedy and action are quite close, both are used to described a movie genre, and action comedy is a popular movie genre. Since these words are closely related in terms of genre and being paired together, they would have similar embeddings.

e. Task 6: Report your best hyper-parameters and their resulting performance.
my_optimizer = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer(learning_rate=0.3)

f. Optional Discussion: You can skip this section.
