a. Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
It shows which classes were misclassified  as other classes. Represents how easily some numbers can be interpreted as another

b. Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task. 
It seems the TensorFlow architecture used used two hidden layers of 100 units each while the class example used a single layer of 512 units. No real improvement over the initial example

c. Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps? 
10 steps - all the weights are noisy and fuzzy with no distinguishable patterns
1000 steps - there are still some noisy weights, but the majority have some pattern on them
