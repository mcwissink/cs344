a. Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
It shows which classes were misclassified  as other classes. Represents how easily some numbers can be interpreted as another

b. Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task. 
It seems the TensorFlow architecture treats each pixel as a feature column, while the Keras example did the more sophisticated patching approach, but unless that logic is hidden in the DNNClassifier. Also, the TensorFlow architecture uses a SoftMax activation function instead of the relu used in the Keras example. 

c. Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps? 
10 steps - all the weights are noisy and fuzzy with no distinguishable patterns
1000 steps - there are still some noisy weights, but the majority have some pattern on them
