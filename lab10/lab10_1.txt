a. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
Keras makes the models easiest to build and conceptually understand while greatly reducing the boiler place good of TensorFlow. But it does come at a cost since Keras will be harder to program custom functionality. However, I would prefer Keras.

b. Task 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.002,
    steps=3000,
    batch_size=150,
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)
