a. categorical data are discrete, textual values that represent a contextual meaning (cities, color, gender). Numerical data can be discrete or continuous numerical values. Categorical data can be represented as numerical data by assigning each category an integer value.

b.
Task 1
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00001,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=8
)
RMSE = 167.30

Task 2
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00002,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=8,
    input_feature="population"
)
RMSE = 176.03

c. The hyperparameters are learning_rate, steps, and batch_size. There is no real standard for tuning the parameters; rather, it's a matter of intuition and learning as you see the results of an attempted parameterization. Recognizing a good training error is important.
