    "Introspection might give a little insight into the congnitive processes, but I don't think it is valuable for modelling the mind. If you really wanted to model the human mind, monitoring it through experiments or through external observation would seem to be more powerful. The problem with instrospection is that it is subjective, despite the attempts for the practitioner to be unbiased in their analysis. It seems that humans tend to overestimate their thought processes/intelligence, when it really isn't all that complicated. Rather, it's the simple, unconscious subprocesses that are impressive aspects of the brain."

    "I formulated the problem by representing the path of the travelling salesman as an ordered array of locations that loops around to the start. The locations are represented using their (x, y) coordinates, and the distances between two locations is calculated using the straight distance between the two points. The value function calculates the total distance of the path using these metrics (and makes it negative for max value processing). The actions are unique combinations of two locations that get swapped in the result function. The goal test always returns false because there is no known solution."
