Entities
A, B, C, table

Facts
1. A is on B
2. B is on C
3. The table support C
4. For any two entities, if the first entity supports the second, then the second is on the first. 
5. For any two entities, if the first entity is on the second, then the first is “above” the second. 
6. For any three entities, if the first entity is above the second which is above the third, then the first is above the third. 

Proof
5(A, B) -> A is above B
5(B, C) -> B is above C
4(table, C) -> C is on the table
5(C, table) -> C is above the table
6(A, B, C) -> A is above C
6(A, C, table) -> A is above the table
