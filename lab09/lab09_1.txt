Exercise 9.1
a. How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?
The linear regression isn't very effective at fitting the model as the resulting RMSE varies extremely. We would normally expect the RMSE of the model to exponentially decrease. 

b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss. 
L2 is the linear loss function used in linear regression, where LogLoss is the logarithmic loss function used in linear classification. L2 works to fit data to a linear model, making sure weights stay small and near 0, where LogLoss is used for classification, giving a probability of certainty. L2 loss is not designed to optimize for probabilities.

c. Task 2: Explain how effective logistic regression is compared with linear regression.
When training with the logistic regression model, we see a more consistent decrease in the loss value, and does so at an exponential rate. Both of these features are things that linear regression failed to achieve.

d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them. 
linear_classifier = train_linear_classifier_model(
    learning_rate=0.000005,
    steps=10000,
    batch_size=200,
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

AUC on the validation set: 0.80
Accuracy on the validation set: 0.78
