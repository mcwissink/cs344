Exercise 6.2
a. Framing
   1. Identify whether an email in Gmail is "important"
   2. My ideal outcome is to only label emails as "important" if they require my immediate attention
   3. a. The success metric
      b. The key results is correctly predicting 95% or more of important emails
      c. The ML model is a failure if the number of predicted important emails is no better than the current heuristic or model
   4. The output from the ML model will be the whether the email is important or not. 0 = the email is unimportant, 1 = the email is important
   5. The output will be made when a new email is received. The outcome will be used for labeling the email as important
   6. If we didn't use ML, we would use text analysis or a white-list of important senders
   
b. Formulating
   7. Binary classification
   8. rows = emails
      output = 0 or 1 for important
   9. inputs = sender, metadata, 1D list of subject tokens, 1D list of email tokens
   10. sender and 1D list of subject tokens would produce a reasonable outcome
