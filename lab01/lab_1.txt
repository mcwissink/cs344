a.
b.
  i. the GPS problem solver is implemented as a class
  ii. they objects are all lists of objects or strings
  iii. the mechanism is recursive since achieve_all calls achieve, achieve calls apply_operators, and then apply_operators calls achieve_all
c.
d.
  i. the hungry monkey puzzle
  ii. each actions specifies the action, the preconditions, the new state, the old state
  iii. the GPS recursively searches for a solution by applying actions that satisfy the current precondition of current action or goal. This recursion eventually unwinds once an actionable action is considered
  iv. the code isn't necessarily intelligent; rather, the code makes use of an exhaustively predefined problem that essentially has the solution built into the definition of the problem. By definition, the GPS isn't a rational agent since it fails when there is any level of uncertainty (an action is not defined for a precondition). It's possible that even when a solution exists, the GPS could irrationally use an inefficient path if there are multiple paths to the solution.
  v. Yes, the monkey would have to intelligently define the preconditions and possible actions by exploring the environment.
