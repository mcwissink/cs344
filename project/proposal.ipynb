    "The goal for my project is to develop a neural network that can efficiently solve the wumpus world problem. This project would make me explore topics on reinforcement learning and Q-learning. The wumpus world problem is a game that is easy enough to code and be quickly simulated for fast training. I also want to make the game more interesting by having the wumpus move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without knowing much about reinforcement leaning, I could imagine that the network would take in the surrounding cells as input and have all possible actions as a softmax output. I will have to do more research on how to properly train this model."
