# Wumpus World DQN
The Wumpus World is a game that requires an agent to navigate a 4x4 cave with limited senses. The objective is to grab the gold and exit the cave while dodging pits and the Wumpus.

This project aims to solve the Wumpus world game using a DQN agent. By playing enough games, the DQN should produce an agent that can somewhat successully navigate the game.
